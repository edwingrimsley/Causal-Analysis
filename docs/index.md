# QMSS 75000 / SOC 81900: Causal Analysis for Public Policy and Social Science

Fall '26, CUNY Graduate Center

---

## Course Overview

This course trains students to design, critique, and execute rigorous causal analyses for public policy and social science research. Causal inference is treated as a design problem, not a statistical trick — regression, matching, weighting, difference-in-differences, regression discontinuity, instrumental variables, experiments, and sensitivity analysis are useful only when tied to a clear estimand, a plausible identification strategy, and transparent evidence about threats to validity.

Students will work primarily in R, replicating published estimates, diagnosing assumptions, and building toward an original causal research paper. In this course we will answer questions including:

- What does it mean for a claim to be causal, and why is a correlation not enough?
- How do experiments, matching, fixed effects, difference-in-differences, and instrumental variables each solve the identification problem differently?
- How credible is a given research design, and what would make a skeptical reader believe it?
- How do you translate a substantive policy question into an estimand, a design, and an analysis plan?

## Late Submission Policy

Because many assignments feed directly into seminar discussion and peer review, late work should be discussed with the instructor before the deadline whenever possible. Genuine constraints will be accommodated, but silent late submissions may be penalized.

## Academic Integrity

The course follows CUNY academic integrity policies. Proper attribution is required for data, code, published research, and AI-assisted work. Do not submit fabricated results, unverifiable citations, or code you cannot explain.

  - As you read: What did the researchers randomize, and what did they not? Which comparisons in the paper are experimental, and which are before-and-after?

**Week 6 — Matching and Propensity Scores · Read before class on October 8**

- Austin, P. C. (2011). An Introduction to Propensity Score Methods for Reducing the Effects of Confounding in Observational Studies. *Multivariate Behavioral Research*, 46(3), 399–424. [Free article](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3144483/) — *Main reading*
  - Read closely the sections on propensity score matching, balance diagnostics, and variable selection; skim the other methods (stratification, weighting, covariate adjustment).
  - As you read: Why might treated and untreated people differ before treatment? How do we determine whether matching produced a credible comparison group? Why can good balance on observed characteristics still leave confounding from unobserved characteristics?
- *The debate: college-in-prison and propensity score matching.* Vera used matching to compare incarcerated college participants with similar nonparticipants and reported lower reconviction among participants; Jennifer Doleac (Arnold Ventures) argued that participants may differ in motivation or readiness to change in ways recorded characteristics miss.
  - Turner, N. (2023, December 6). Impact Over Orthodoxy. Vera Institute of Justice. [Read](https://www.vera.org/news/impact-over-orthodoxy)
  - Gelman, A. (2024, June 13). Arnold Foundation and Vera Institute Argue about a Study of the Effectiveness of College Education Programs in Prison. *Statistical Modeling, Causal Inference, and Social Science*. [Read](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2024/06/13/arnold-foundation-and-vera-institute-argue-about-a-study-of-the-effectiveness-of-college-education-programs-in-prison/) — includes Doleac's critique
  - For discussion: Can a study provide useful policy evidence without convincingly identifying a causal effect, and how should researchers communicate that distinction?

[Free article](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2943670/) — places propensity scores within the broader matching toolkit and emphasizes designing the comparison before looking at outcomes.

**Week 7 — Fixed Effects · Read before class on October 15**

- Huntington-Klein, N. *The Effect*, ch. 16, "Fixed Effects." [Free online](https://theeffectbook.net/ch-FixedEffects.html) — *Main reading*
  - Read 16.1–16.2 and 16.3.1 (clustered standard errors) closely; skim random effects and nonlinear models.
- Western, B. (2002). The Impact of Incarceration on Wage Mobility and Inequality. *American Sociological Review*, 67(4), 526–546. [Published](https://doi.org/10.1177/000312240206700403) — *Application*
  - Uses NLSY79 data with person fixed effects: incarceration cuts wages by 10–20% and slows wage growth by about 30%.
- Imai, K. & Kim, I. S. (2019). When Should We Use Unit Fixed Effects Regression Models for Causal Inference with Longitudinal Data? *American Journal of Political Science*, 63(2), 467–490. [Free PDF](https://imai.fas.harvard.edu/research/files/FEmatch.pdf) — *Critique*
  - Unit fixed effects remove time-invariant confounders, but only by ruling out dynamics: past outcomes can't shape current treatment, and past treatment can't shape current outcomes.
- As you read: What does a fixed effect remove, and what kinds of confounding can it never remove? In Western's study, which differences between people who were and weren't incarcerated do person fixed effects handle, and which do they miss? Is Imai and Kim's no-dynamics assumption plausible when the "treatment" is contact with the criminal justice system?
- *Optional:* Vaisey, S. & Miles, A. (2017). What You Can—and Can't—Do With Three-Wave Panel Data. *Sociological Methods & Research*, 46(1), 44–67. [Published](https://doi.org/10.1177/0049124114547769) — fixed effects rest on two rarely tested assumptions, and the wrong lag can flip a coefficient's sign.
- *Optional:* Mummolo, J. & Peterson, E. (2018). Improving the Interpretation of Fixed Effects Regression Results. *Political Science Research and Methods*, 6(4), 829–835. [Free PDF](https://jmummolo.scholar.princeton.edu/document/151) — how much variation is left once units are compared only with themselves.
